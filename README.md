# Number Guessing Game in Rust

This is my introduction to Rust programming language.

To build the image and run for the first time, run following:

```
docker build -t rust-guessing-game:0.1.0 .
docker run -it --name rust-guessing-game rust-guessing-game:0.1.0
```

Then, when you want to play, just run:

```
docker start -i rust-guessing-game
```
